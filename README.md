# SOLAS Match

## What is this?

The Rosetta Foundation SOLAS Match is a web application. It
is designed to be accessed by two groups: NGOs seeking to have content
translated, and volunteer translators who may complete such tasks.
Accessed through the browser, the application displays a list of
translation tasks previously uploaded to the system. A task may have
one resource file attached to it which can be downloaded, translated,
and re-uploaded. Development began in February 2011.

## Version 14

- Removed Rabbit MQ from the system because our drivers are very old.

- Added a table "qxt_smtp_emails" in which the SMTP driver contains a reference to the previous table and are marked as sent when sent over the socket to the remote SMTP server. Likewise these are not deleted so we can work out what to resend if that is necessary.

- More information is given before confirming task cancellation about what exactly happens: "Note: when you cancel a task all tasks in the same language pair/file combination will also be cancelled. Additionally an email will be sent to any linguists working on the tasks."
- Once assigned, task "unit_rate" is updated to the linguist rate for the task's type and language pair (which is set for linguists whose rate differs from the default, these are contained in the table "user_rate_pairs").

- The HubSpot Google Sheet is imported into the "hubspot_deals" table when a project with a non zero Deal ID is edited OR if the new "Sync HubSpot" feature on the Admin page is used,
- A new value for the "status" field has been added to "project_complete_dates". This is in addition to "0" (New) and "1" (Complete). The new "status" is "2" (In Progress) and is set when all non-cancelled Tasks are In Progress (but not all Complete).
- A table "zahara_purchase_orders" now contains data from the Zahara Google Sheet.

## Version 13.0

- Updated Google tracking codes for twbplatform.org.
- There is now logging in place for all emails sent in "email_sents" table: recipient_id, task_id, project_id, org_id, translator_id, admin_id, badge_id, topic, logged_time as appropriate.
- Added cleaner "start" and "stop" commands for backend C++.
- Volunteer letters and certificate requests can be generated by site admins (from the volunteer's profile)

## Version 12.4

- When an email is changed in TWB Platform...
  - In Phrase, the email is changed.
  - In Moodle, the email is changed.
  - If any of the emails was not successfully changed, it will be reported back to the user.
- When a user is deleted in TWB Platform...
  - In Phrase, the email will be set to the same randomised email as the one in TWB Platform. Other names will also be overwritten/randomised.
  - The TWB Community account will be deleted.
  - The Moodle user will be deleted.
- A link to "TWB Learning Center" has been added to TWB Platform pages

- Claimed tasks "any task status" filter now working

## Version 12.3

- The password reset mechanism has been simplified.
  - Multiple password reset emails will now be sent when requested (not just one).
  - These will all be identical, so any of the identical links can be used (this is to avoid user confusion). THE C++ code has been updated to allow identical emails to go out in this case.
  - However there will be a limit of 4 emails a day to avoid possible spamming.
  - If a user requests a password reset before they have acted on the verification email from registration (and users seem to do this), completing password reset will act as a substitute (verifying the user's email).
  - There is a button in user's profile (visible only to admins and only if the user has requested a reset) which says "Link emailed to User for Password Reset". Clicking on this will bring up the link which can be sent to a user having trouble. Or could be used to reset a password on a user's behalf.
- Task Stream emails were being processed in a way that caused queues to overflow. Now the decision to send or not is made earlier so there is no risk of overflow.
- Links to the dev instance of Phrase from dev.translatorswb.org will now work (project and task pages).

  - Set the TWB wordcount to whatever it was before (word_count_original).
  - Set the audit trail to show un-cancelled.
- https://kato.translatorswb.org/org/dashboard/ has a new % complete calculation based on words completed.
- When a user's email is changed on TWB Platform, the next time the user logs into TWB Community, their email will be updated there.
